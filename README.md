# ArduinoChronometer
This is a code for an chronometer who contains an  mechanical and ultrasonic sensors.
I used this project for regist the time that a drone cover in a know distance. 
The chronometer starts when the drone take off and it will stop when 
the ultrasonic sersor detect de drone.

I have also attached an image of how I made the hardware part on an arduino uno board.
